# CFPB trend data downloader

Tool for downloading CFPB trend data using the CFPB's [Consumer Complaints Database API](https://cfpb.github.io/api/ccdb/).

Work on this is in progress, but it is [live for use](http://gideonweissman.com/cfpb_data_downloader). You can also run the program on your own PHP server.

Feedback and collaboration are welcome.
